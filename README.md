## Development

Before you can start developing, you need to install dependencies. Audición uses the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

It is highly recommended to install git hooks in the project repository. They make it easier to follow code style. To install them, run the command:

```sh
pnpm hook
```

To start web app in development mode, run the command:

```sh
pnpm dev
```
